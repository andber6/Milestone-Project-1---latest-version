## My first website! Milestone project 1 by André Bergan
# PROJECT PURPOSE
This website presents my work for the first milestone project. 
This is my very first project I have done after starting to learn about software development. 
This website is a description/autobiography of myself and demonstrates my ability in HTML5 and CSS3. It also includes
a brief description of me as a person and about my future plans.


# UX

Navigating to different sections of the page is made possible by the navigation bar, which is set at the top of the page. 
It also collapses on smaller screens to take up less space and make for a better user experience.
Potential employers can quickly navigate through the navigation bar to get to the section they wish to visit. 
In the images section, you can view a handful of pictures of me throughout the last few years.
The carousel includes a "hire me" button that links to the "contact me" section so that it is easier for the reader to navigate.
Included a "logo picture" of me in the navigation bar so that the user can see a representation of myself at the beginning as well as adding style to the page.
It also shows a visual representation of my ability with HTML5 and CSS3.

# Testing
During the creation of this project, I have overcome numerous obstacles I have faced along the way.
Especially to make everything layed out how I picture it in my head and making it responsive like I imagine it to look. 
Often times things shift when I adjust something else, which ends up ruining the whole structure of the page. I had to work around this and 
find a way to make it all fit together nicely, which I believe I have managed to do.
Although this has taken up a lot of my time and effort, I learned a lot from it and I am pleased with the final result.
Getting the carousel to work how I wanted it to was also quite a hassle, but it turned out fine in the end.
Also, when working on this project I was having issues with my commit history, which I wasn't sure how to go about so I ended up
just creating a seperate reposity for the latest version of my project, which I hope is fine. If it's necessary, you can find the rest of my commit history
in my first milestone project repository called 1. Milestone-Project.
